## What Is The Pseudo Secure Initiative and Why Was It Built
The Pseduo Secure Initiative is an app prototype I decided to build for my final project while attending Digital Crafts; 
a 16 week full-time, immersive coding boot camp. After having my car broken into the alarm was damaged and disabled. 
Because of this event, it caused me to become more aware of how prevalent burglary and petty theft really are and how 
expensive security systems can become. This inspired me to build a portable sensor that would notify a user with a text 
message when motion is detected. The goal is to lower the cost of installation fees associated with wiring harnesses in 
vehicles; aiming to create a temporary, inexpensive solution for those in need of a more affordable alternative. The total 
after having a new baseline alarm system installed in my car was $350. This prototype design, however currently costs $25 
wholesale to build and does not require a specialist to install into a vehicle and can be used inside a home or anywhere 
with access to a wifi connection. This is the process I went through to build this system and what I learned along the way. 
This project was built for educational purposes.

## Technologies used

## Process Build, Challenges, and Site Walkthrough

### Planning
### Giving Power to the Super Sonic Sensor, LED, and Horns
### Powering the 8266 Wifi chip, downloading the drivers and libraries
### Voltage Dividing and powering the 8266 wifi-chip ADC pin
### Glimpse into the Arduino 8266 Wifi Chip C++ Code
### Glimpse into the Arduino 8266 Wifi Chip C++ Code
### Glimpse into the Nodejs and Twilio Backend Code
### Future Goals and Added Features
* Incorporate a range extender for those whose wifi connection may not allow the sensor to be useful outdoors, such as in a driveway or garage. 
<br>
* Eliminate the need for a wifi-connection altogether and create an alternative to long distance security options where wifi isn't available, such as a public parking lot or with street parking outside a wifi range. 
<br>
* Expand on the back end functionality and make the user experience more fluid, pertaining to registering a product and product support. 
<br>
* Add additional sensors to widen the range of the sensor to be 45 degrees with 3 sensors as opposed to only 1 with a 15-degree view. <br>
